### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 1 was a favorite because it was interesting to see how “if” statements can limit the day and time you want in order for the program to run. I also learned how "and" and "or" are used in “if” statements. It was also interesting to see that booleans were used in each function to determine which statements were true or false.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 1 was a favorite because for loops were introduced in this lab. Although a little confusing, it helped me understand how “for each loops” were used . I also learned how to use static_cast when changing an int value to a double.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part 2 was a favorite because ifstream and ofstream were used in this lab. Through it, I learned how to open files and close files while also learning what part of the code I should be using it. I also learned that .good can be used in “if” statements to check if it can run or not.
